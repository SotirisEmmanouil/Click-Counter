# Click Counter GUI
Program with a GUI interface written in Java that counts the amount of times the button is clicked on. Inspired by similar programs/webpages seen in various "Youtube" challenges where one must say a word X amount of times and must keep count of the amount of times they have already said it. It features a reset button which resets the counter.There is JavaDoc accompanying the source code. This project helped me learned more about `JButton`, `JLabel`, and `JTextField`.
