# CounterGUI
Program with GUI interface that counts the amount of times the button is clicked on. Inspired by similar programs/webpages which offer the same functionality with programs that are seen in various "Youtube" challeneges where one must say a word X amount of times and must keep count of the amount of times they have already said it. 
There is JavaDoc accompanying the source code.
